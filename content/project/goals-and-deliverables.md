## Plan to deliver:    
* Create a basic 2d heatmap showing wifi distribution from a birds eye view. Essentially a non-interactive version of the project here.
* How to measure the quality / performance of the system
    * Measure scene based on real world router locations and test wifi signals against simulated data.
* What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
    * How do signals interact/interfere  when there are multiple routers?  
    * Assuming a single material for the simulation, how to simulate the signal propagation in a model room?
    * What is the optimal location for the router? 

## Hope to deliver: 
* Create an interactive panable 3d heat map of the scene showing interesting interference effects from rays bouncing off walls
    * Extremely ambitious: Walk around a room in VR and query wifi speeds at different locations by pointing at it, essentially a speedtest button that someone could then test out by pulling out a device and running the speed test from there.
* How to measure the quality / performance of the system
    * Measure scene based on real world router locations and test wifi signals against simulated data and different building materials.
* What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
    * How do signals interact with surrounding material and how to simulate the materials in our technology stack?
    * How to measure the materials RF interaction properties?
    * How does incorporating the different material affect the signal propagation?
    * What materials block the wifi the most/least?
