In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.

### Week1
Make key design decisions
* Research/compare radiosity, widening camera field of view in terms of extensiveness of changes required for proj 3-2 as well as the quality of the heat map produced with each.
    * We are currently weighing how to get the wifi reception at each point, between two main contenders 
        * Radiosity, a way of computing the global state of the image so we could pan around our heat map
        * Widening the cameraâ€™s field of view so it is essentially shooting out rays 360 degrees.
    * Research/compare development cost of simulating the router as the light source versus the router as the camera.
* Research waves to understand/model phases/interference
* Research material modeling and how to modify material qualities in proj 3-2

### Week 2
Implement a test scene and bounce some signals through them
* Implement the widened field of view or radiosity for some basic project 3-2 scene
* Add phases to the proj3-2 rays
* Start creating/ finding scenes to use 
* Implemente interactive features 
* Crude version of 2d heatmap with one router and at least one object blocking signal, using ray tracing

### Week 3
* Create a scheme for converting wifi values at points to a heat map
* Create a basic scene with a couple of different materials
* Show some basic interference result
* Have the ability to see the signals at different locations complete by end of this week
* Work to expand towards having N routers 
* Have slides and video done for the milestone

### Week 4
* Make sure we can expand implementation to different scenes
* Have sanity check of everything created so far 
* Expand from 2d to 3d heat map
