## Updated work plan:
### This week:
* Go to office hours to really understand the light model and what needs to be tweaked
    * Implement modifications to ray that model it more as a radio wave than a light wave
* Create a scene with the “cellphones” on the highly used regions of the room.
* Show their brightness changes relative to where the wifi router is placed
### Endgame:
* Get light sources to move around the edge of the room
* Automate code to computer the brightness value of each of the cellphones for each router placement
* Output a picture of the optimal router placement and the generated image with the cellphones in it and their brightness.
* Generate a more realistic scene modelled after one of our rooms.
Things to report in milestone:
Steps toward final project completion:
Development an algorithm that can help the user find the best spot to place a wifi router (or two+)
Build a more complex scene that can be a model house/apartment
Improve our modeling of radio waves
